# Tensorflow Lite MiDaS iOS Example

### Requirements

- XCode 11.0 or above
- iOS 12.0 or above, [iOS 14 breaks the NPU Delegate](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/43339)
- TensorFlow 2.4.0, TensorFlowLiteSwift -> 0.0.1-nightly

## Quick Start with a MiDaS Example

MiDaS is a neural network to compute depth from a single image. It uses TensorFlowLiteSwift / C++ libraries on iOS. The code is written in Swift.

### Install TensorFlow

Set default python version to python3:

```
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshenv
echo 'alias python=python3' >> ~/.zshenv
echo 'alias pip=pip3' >> ~/.zshenv
```

Install TensorFlow

```shell
pip install tensorflow
```

### Install TensorFlowLiteSwift via Cocoapods

Set required TensorFlowLiteSwift version in the file (`0.0.1-nightly` is recommended): https://github.com/AlexeyAB/midas_tf_ios/blob/main/Podfile#L9

Install: brew, ruby, cocoapods

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install mc rbenv ruby-build
sudo gem install cocoapods
```


The TensorFlowLiteSwift library is available in [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), to integrate it to our project, we can run in the root directory of the project:

```ruby
pod install
```

Now open the `Midas.xcworkspace` file in XCode, select your iPhone device (XCode->Product->Destination->iPhone) and launch it (cmd + R). If everything works well, you should see a real-time depth map from your camera.

### Model

The TensorFlow (TFlite) model `midas.tflite` is in the folder `/Midas/Model`


To use another model, you should convert it from TensorFlow saved-model to TFlite model (so that it can be deployed):

```python
saved_model_export_dir = "./saved_model"
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model(saved_model_export_dir)    
tflite_model = converter.convert()
open(model_tflite_name, "wb").write("model.tflite")
```

### Setup XCode

* Open directory `.xcworkspace` from the XCode

* Press on your ProjectName (left-top corner) -> change Bundle Identifier to `com.midas.tflite-npu` or something like this (it should be unique)

* select your Developer Team (your should be signed-in by using your AppleID)

* Connect your iPhone (if you want to run it on real device instead of simulator), select your iPhone device (XCode->Product->Destination->iPhone)

* Click in the XCode: Product -> Run

* On your iPhone device go to the: Settings -> General -> Device Management (or Profiles) -> Apple Development -> Trust Apple Development
