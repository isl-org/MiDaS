The pre-trained model corresponds to `DS 4` with multi-objective optimization enabled.

### Changelog 
* **[Dec 2019] Released new version of MiDaS - the new model is significantly more accurate and robust**
* [Jul 2019] Initial release of MiDaS ([Link](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS/releases/tag/v1))

### Setup 

1) Download the model weights [model.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nqW_Hwj86kslfsXR7EnXpEWdO2csz1cC) and place the
file in the root folder.

2) Set up dependencies: 

    ```shell
    conda install pytorch torchvision opencv
    ```

   The code was tested with Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.2.0, and OpenCV 3.4.2.

    
### Usage

1) Place one or more input images in the folder `input`.

2) Run the model:

    ```shell
    python run.py
    ```

3) The resulting inverse depth maps are written to the `output` folder.

### Dataset

Because of copyright laws the source videos cannot be released. However if you obtained 3D videos on your own, the scripts in [this sibling repository](https://github.com/lasinger/3DVideos2Stereo) should help you generate the dataset.
